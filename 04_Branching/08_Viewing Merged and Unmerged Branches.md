# Viewing Merged and Unmerged Branches

## List merge branches `--merged`

When we are finished working in a branch, we should merge it into **_`main`_**, and afterwards delete it.

To view the list of merged branches run the following command:

```bash
git branch --merged
```

## List unmerged branches `--no-merged`

To view the list of unmerged branches run

```bash
git branch --no-merged
```
