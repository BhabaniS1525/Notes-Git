# Skip Staging Area

If we are sure our changes do not need to be reviewed, we can skip the staging area.

To do this we run the command `git commit -a -m "My message"`, we supply the flag `-a`, that means all modified files. Or we can use `git commit -am "My message"`, combining `-a -m`.

```bash
‚ùØ git commit -am 'Add details to lesson'
[main d0dd608] Add details to lesson
 1 file changed, 10 insertions(+)
```
