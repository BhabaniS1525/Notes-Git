# Initializing a Repository

- Create a directory anywhere.
- navigate to the directory using `cd <directory>` and run `git init`. it will return the following message:

```bash
‚ùØ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/user/code/.git/
```

- Inside the project folder the command `git init` has created a folder `.git`,
- it's by default hidden because it contains the working backend of git.
